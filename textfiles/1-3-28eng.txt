Centripetal force: It is the force that appears on an object in circular motion, trying to move away from the center of the circle. 

Centrifugal separation: It is a technique to separate substances by rotating a mixture. For example, when wet clothes are put into a washing machine and undergo a spin-drying process, the force of rapid rotation causes the moisture to be thrown outwards, and only the dried clothes remain inside the washing machine, following the same principle.
