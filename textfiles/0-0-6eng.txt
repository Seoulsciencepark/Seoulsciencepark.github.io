The Great East Geographic Map: This map is estimated to be a reduced version of the "Great East Geographic Map" created by Kim Jeong-ho (1804~1866), a geographer of the late Joseon dynasty. Like the "Great East Geographic Map," it represents mountains with sawtooth-shaped lines, with the thickness of the lines indicating the size of the mountains. Rivers are depicted with double lines to differentiate them from the single-line road network. Each district is accurately labeled, and the road network is detailed, with the distance to the capital, Hanyang, recorded next to the place names. The boundaries of the Korean peninsula are marked with dashed lines, and there is a brief overview of the territory written in the map's margins. Particularly, it is unique that the influence of rivers is represented by crosshatching.
