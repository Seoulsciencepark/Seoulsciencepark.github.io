Hontcheonyi: It is an astronomical clock that measures the movement of the sun, moon, and stars using two celestial globes, Honyuwa (which observes the movement and position of celestial bodies) and Honsang-i (which rotates the stars according to the time and season). It was first created during the reign of King Sejong in the Joseon Dynasty (1434) by Jeongcho, Parkyeon, Kimjin, and underwent several repairs for over 100 years. In 1584, a new Hontcheonyi was created and kept in Hongmun-gwan (a government office for astronomical observations), but it was lost in a fire during the Japanese Invasion of Korea in the Imjin War. In 1659, Choi Yu-ji created a new version called Seongiokhyeong (Hontcheonyi), but it has not been passed down.
