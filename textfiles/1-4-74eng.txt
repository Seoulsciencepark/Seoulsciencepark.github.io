What is nano? A nanometer is one billionth of a meter, which is equivalent to one hundred thousandth of the thickness of an adult's hair. Nanotechnology refers to the technology of processing or assembling materials at the atomic or molecular level to create new substances. Some materials made up of the same carbon atoms, but with different properties due to the arrangement of atoms, include graphite and diamond, as well as innovative materials such as fullerene, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. Nanotechnology, which involves assembling atoms or molecules to create materials with new functions, is expected to contribute to the advancement of various fields such as information and communication technology, biotechnology, medicine, environment, and energy in the future.
