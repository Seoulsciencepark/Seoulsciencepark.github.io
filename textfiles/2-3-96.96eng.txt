Types of Rockets
Rockets can be divided into three categories depending on their purpose: research and exploration, satellite launch, and military use. They can also be classified into solid rockets and liquid rockets based on the type of fuel used. In the future, nuclear rockets, ion rockets, and photon rockets are also expected to emerge.
