Observation technique: The clearest result is achieved when the flashing cycle of the flashing light matches exactly with the rotation speed of the observation plate. Usage: 1. Press the start button. 2. Rotate the observation plate using the low-speed or high-speed switch. 3. Turn the frequency adjustment switch of the flashing light to observe the phenomenon where the image on the observation plate becomes still. 4. Check the speed at which the flashing light flashes per second and determine the rotation speed of the observation plate per second.
