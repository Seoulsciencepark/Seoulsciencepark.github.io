Large convex lens: Let's stand facing each other with the lens in between. Let's observe the changes in appearance as we move our positions back and forth. What is the relationship between the distance from the lens and the size of the appearance? When an object is between the lens and the focal point, a larger appearance is formed than the object itself. As the object gets closer to the focal point, the appearance becomes increasingly larger.
