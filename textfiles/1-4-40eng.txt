Polarization: Polarization is a transverse wave where the vibration direction is limited to only one direction. Natural light is a transverse wave that vibrates in all directions within a plane that is perpendicular to the propagation direction. When this natural light is passed through a polarizer such as an electric stone, only the ray with a vibration plane parallel to the optic axis is transmitted. This is called polarization.
