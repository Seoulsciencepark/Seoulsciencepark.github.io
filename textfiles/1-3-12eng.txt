Press the switch to set the ball in motion, and then observe the motion of the ball carefully. 1. How does the velocity of the ball change? Where does it increase and where does it decrease? Are there any intervals where the velocity remains constant? 2. Where does the ball obtain its kinetic energy from? 3. What happens when the two balls placed on the horizontal rail at the bottom left collide? The potential energy converts into sound energy, heat energy (frictional heat), and kinetic energy.
