Nuclear Transplantation: Nuclear transplantation is a technique in which the nucleus is removed from one cell and inserted into another egg cell that has already had its nucleus removed, creating a new organism. It allows for the replication of desirable organisms in large quantities and the development of new species with the advantageous traits of two different species. Examples include the chimera mouse, dark-feathered cattle, and cloned sheep Dolly. Clones are the offspring with identical genetic composition that are generated asexually from a single cell or individual. Obtaining these clones is known as cloning. In the future, with the advancement of cloning technology, we may be able to obtain large quantities of superior livestock breeds using this method.
