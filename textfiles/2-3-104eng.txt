Genetic recombination refers to the technique of cutting out necessary genes (DNA) from a different organism and recombining them with the genes of the desired organism. This method is mainly used to efficiently and in large quantities produce proteins, which are products of genes. 

1. Gene extraction: The gene extraction method involves finding the desired gene, cutting it out with specific restriction enzymes, and then cutting the vector (in this case, a plasmid) with the same restriction enzymes. There are various types of restriction enzymes. Each restriction enzyme is a DNA scissors that recognizes specific sequences of nucleotides in the DNA molecule and cuts only specific parts. 

2. Connection of the vector and the desired gene: The cut gene and vector are connected with ligase. DNA strands cut with the same restriction enzyme have the same shape at both ends, making recombination easy. In other words, ligase acts as the glue that binds the cut genes together. The resulting plasmid is called recombinant DNA. 

3. Cultivation of cells after recombination: Selection of transformed E. coli cells: The recombinant DNA is transferred back into E. coli cells and grown. The plasmid contains a gene that provides resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, E. coli that survives on a medium containing antibiotics have the recombinant DNA. Cultivation of cells: E. coli can divide every 17 minutes under optimal conditions. Therefore, a single E. coli can multiply up to 70 billion in one day. Due to this vigorous reproductive ability, E. coli is widely used to amplify the desired genes. By using recombinant DNA, it is possible to produce proteins that can be used to treat diseases. Insulin, which can treat diabetes, is already being mass-produced through genetic recombination, providing treatment for numerous diabetes patients.
