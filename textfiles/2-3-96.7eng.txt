Rocket Fuel: Solid Fuel: Solid chemicals used as fuel. The usage method is simple, but it is difficult to control the combustion rate, and the propulsive force is weaker than that of liquid fuel. Liquid Fuel: Uses high-pressure liquefied fuels such as liquid hydrogen, and it is easy to control the combustion rate and has strong propulsive force. It is widely used in rockets that carry artificial satellites. Rocket fuel includes solid fuels, liquid hydrogen, and ethyl alcohol, among others. Liquid fuel is highly compressed under high pressure and vaporizes as it is injected from the nozzle, leading to combustion.
