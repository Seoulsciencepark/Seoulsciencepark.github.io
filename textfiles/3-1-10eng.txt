Carl Zeiss Planetarium: The planetarium (celestial projector) is equipment that projects the constellations of the sky, as well as the movements of the Sun and planets, onto the dome screen in the celestial projection room, for the purpose of conducting education in astronomy and space science.
The planetarium was first invented in 1923 by the German optical company Carl Zeiss AG, making it the world's first planetarium. The planetarium exhibited here was produced by Carl Zeiss AG and installed in the celestial projection room of the Namsan Branch of the Seoul Science Exhibition Hall in 1992 (currently the Namsan Branch of the Seoul Convergence Science Educational Institute). (It is also the first Carl Zeiss planetarium introduced for astronomical education in Korea.)
In 2023, a new model of Carl Zeiss planetarium was newly installed in the celestial projection room, and this planetarium has now been permanently preserved as a historical exhibit.
