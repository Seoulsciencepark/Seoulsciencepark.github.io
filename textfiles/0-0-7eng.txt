Dongguk Yeoji Jido: This is a national map of Korea that was created by the painter Yoon Duseo (1668~1715) during the reign of King Sukjong of Joseon. The form of the map follows the style of the early Joseon period, following the types of the Jeongcheok and Yangseong Ji maps. As befitting a famous painter of that time, it showcases vibrant colors, and the portrayal of mountain ridges reflects traditional terrain recognition, with large ridges drawn boldly to emphasize them. Specifically, the map provides detailed representations of the sea routes between the West Sea, Coastal Areas, and the mainland. It is unique in having triangular-shaped islands, and the use of red lines connecting the islands to their respective counties enhances its distinctiveness.
