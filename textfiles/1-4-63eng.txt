Reason why sound is produced from a harp without strings: There is a light called infrared that is not visible to the human eye in the midst of light. In a harp without strings, infrared is being emitted from top to bottom. When this is blocked by hand, the infrared sensor located at the bottom detects it and sends a signal to the speaker to produce sound.
