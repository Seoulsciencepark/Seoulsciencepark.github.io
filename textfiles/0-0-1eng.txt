Celestial Clock: An astronomical clock that measures the movement of the sun, moon, and stars. The Celestial Clock has been used since the time of King Sejong, but all of them were lost, and only the one made by Song I-yeong in 1669, which was passed down, is currently on display at the Goryeo University Museum. This Celestial Clock consists of two parts: the "Hwon-ui" (an apparatus for observing the movement and position of celestial bodies) and the clock mechanism. The clock mechanism moves by the motion of two weights. One weight uses an escapement (a device that controls the speed, rotating the gear teeth one by one at regular intervals) with 12 wooden plaques (marking the hours) attached to the gear, which indicates the time on the dial. The other weight controls a striking mechanism that tells the time by moving several iron balls. When about four iron balls with a diameter of about 2cm roll down the groove, they strike the bell with an iron hammer.
