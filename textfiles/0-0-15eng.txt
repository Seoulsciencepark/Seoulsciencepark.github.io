Total Archery Car: By installing a total archery frame on top of the car, 50 sets of 4-bow total archery were arranged in 5 rows with 10 sets on each floor. Four bamboo arrows were inserted into each set of 4-bow total archery, and a total of 200 arrows were fired simultaneously. The 4-bow total archery is a weapon that can shoot 4 arrows at once, and the bamboo arrows are thicker than regular arrows but shorter than three-joint arrows.
