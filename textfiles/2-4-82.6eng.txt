Ferns: From the Late Devonian period, 350 million years ago, various types of ferns began to appear, including those in large tree forms. It was during this time that forests started to form on land, and these forests became important sources of coal reserves that exist today. As ferns thrive in warm and moist environments, fossilized fern remains found in layers of rock provide valuable evidence about the conditions of the environment at the time those layers were formed.
