Why does the small ring rolling on a rotating disk tilt to one side? Experimental method: 1. Try rolling the small ring in the opposite direction of the rotating disk. 2. The small ring tilts and rolls to one side instead of moving in a straight line.
This is due to the change in the direction of motion of an object caused by the Earth's rotation, known as centripetal force or the Coriolis force. The phenomenon of a typhoon creating a counterclockwise spiral in the Northern Hemisphere is also explained by the Coriolis force resulting from the rotation of the Earth. The outer part of the rotating disk is faster than the inner part, causing the small ring to tilt and roll to one side.
