What is a liquid magnet? It refers to a fine powder that possesses magnetic properties and is prevented from settling or clumping by adding a surfactant (a substance that reduces surface tension by adsorbing to the surface, soap being a typical example) to a diluted solution. Uses of liquid magnets: In 1965, Dr. Pak of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) began researching the addition of magnetic properties to rocket fuel for smooth supply in a zero-gravity environment. Currently, they are used in fuel additives, printer inks, cosmetics, etc. Ongoing research includes the conversion of magnetic signals into mechanical braking and the use of magnetic fluids for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generation.
