Properties of Light: Experiment 1. Let's observe the path of a straight beam of light after pressing the switch. Which way does the light bend when passing through a concave lens? Which way does the light bend when passing through a convex lens? How is it reflected in a mirror?
Experiment 2. Let's observe the behavior of white light passing through a prism. In how many different colors does it disperse? Why does it disperse into various colors? Does a laser beam also disperse into different colors when passing through a prism?
Principles: 1. Light travels in a straight line within a medium of uniform density. Here, a medium refers to a substance that transmits waves. 2. At the boundary between mediums of different densities, some of the light is reflected. 3. When light enters a medium of different density, its direction changes. 4. White light disperses into various colors when passing through a prism.
