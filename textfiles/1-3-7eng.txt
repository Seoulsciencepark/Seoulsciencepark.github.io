Experiment: 1. Press the top switch to allow air to flow and observe the water level in the tube. Which side of the tube has a higher water level? Why does the difference in water level occur? 2. Press the bottom switch to allow air to flow and observe the shape of the wings. How do the cross-sections of the two wings differ? Why don't both wings float?

Explanation of Bernoulli's principle: Bernoulli was a Swiss theoretical physicist and mathematician. Bernoulli's principle (the conservation of energy in fluid) states that when the height is the same, the product of P+1/2 * d * v^2 is constant (p: pressure, d: density, v: velocity). When we blow horizontally across a book, the air velocity above the paper becomes faster than below, causing the pressure above the paper to be higher than below. As a result, the paper is lifted upwards.
