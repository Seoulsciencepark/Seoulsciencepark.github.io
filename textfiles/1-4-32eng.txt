Lens Play: Where Will the Image Form?
The light that comes out of an object and passes through a convex lens forms an image according to the following rules. Light that enters parallel to the axis of the lens refracts and passes through the back focus (F2). Light that passes through the center of the lens continues straight. Light that passes through the front focus (F1) refracts and continues parallel to the axis.
What will happen to the image if the shape of the aperture changes? The aperture is the device that controls the amount of light. The rules for the formation of the image after the light passes through the convex lens, through various paths, are independent of the shape of the aperture. However, the only change will be in the brightness of the image since the amount of light that passes through depends on the size of the aperture.
