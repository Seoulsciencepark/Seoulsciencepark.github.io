The Secret of the Parabolic Surface: A parabolic surface has a geometric property of focusing light or objects that enter parallel to the axis. Creating a reflective surface in the shape of a parabolic surface for the mirror of a reflector telescope or the reflector of a radio telescope is also done to gather faint light or radio waves that enter parallel from a distant source. * In this exhibit, a cylinder is installed at the focal point of the parabolic antenna reflector to direct the sound waves into the cylinder.
