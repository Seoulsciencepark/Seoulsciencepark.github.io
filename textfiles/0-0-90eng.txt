The universe began from a massive explosion at some point called the Big Bang. The Big Bang, or the great explosion, is believed to have occurred about 13.7 billion years ago, and since this explosion, the universe has continued to expand, giving birth to various galaxies. Within this universe, there are hundreds of billions of galaxies, and our galaxy consists of 200 billion stars. Among these stars is the sun, and the Earth is a small planet revolving around the sun.

Because the Earth rotates, cities with similar latitudes can see similar night skies. Seoul is located at a latitude of 37 degrees north. Cities such as Lisbon, Madrid, Athens, Beijing, California, and Washington DC are situated at similar latitudes, so you can see a night sky similar to that of Seoul from these places.

Only the very bright sun appears in the sky. However, actually stars are also up in the sky. Many people think they can't see the stars because of the bright sunlight. The truth is, stars are not visible because sunlight is scattered and dispersed in the Earth's atmosphere.

Let's make the atmosphere disappear for a moment. Do you see the stars in the sky? Stars are also in the sky during the day, they just aren't visible. 

The sun is quietly setting beyond the western horizon. Gradually, more and more beautiful stars begin to populate the sky. Now, it's as if silver powder has been sprinkled all over the sky, with countless stars shining brightly.

In Korea, during spring, constellations such as the Ox Herding constellation, the Virgin constellation, and the Lion constellation, can be particularly well-seen. The constellation that serves as a reference point for finding these various constellations in the spring is the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major, shinning in the northern sky.

Now, how about we look for a cluster of stars in the night sky resembling a ladle, or a dipper with a long handle? This cluster of stars is the Big Dipper, located in the Great Bear. 

From the front, they are: Dubhe, Merak, Phecda, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, Alkaid. If you have a good eye, you can also see a star called Alcor next to Mizar. Mizar and Alcor have been known as the stars of vision screening since Roman times, and according to Greek Roman mythology, Mizar was married to the youngest princess among the Pleiades, the winter open cluster. 

The Big Dipper is not a constellation name; it is the names of seven bright stars, starting from the tail of Ursa Major to the buttock part. According to ancient Greek mythology, the great bear of Ursa Major is Callisto, the nymph of Artemis, the goddess of the moon and hunting, who was turned into a bear due to the hatred of Hera, the wife of Zeus. 

There are two stars forming a pair in the place corresponding to the feet of the Great Bear, and three stars are lined up in parallel. These are called Sangtae, Jungtae, and Hatae, respectively, and this Samtae are the stars that Koreans used to call Samtaesung . 

Now lets look for the representative constellations of spring. The spring constellations can be easily found using the Big Dipper in the Ursa Major we have found before. If you look at the three stars corresponding to the handle of the Big Dipper, these stars do not form a straight line but form a curve. If you extend this curve to the back, you will find a first-magnitude star with orange color.

This star is Arcturus of the Herdsman constellation, and it is also the third brightest first magnitude star in the northern sky. The main character of Ursa Major, Callisto, who became a bear, lived alone in the forest, and after a few years, Callisto's son Arcas, who became an excellent hunter, encountered Callisto who became a bear one day. Callisto, who recognized her son at a glance, approached Arcas, but Arcas, who did not recognize his mother, tried to kill it with an arrow. Zeus, watching this from the clouds, felt pity for both of them and made them into constellations in the sky. 

Arcas became the herdsman constellation that follows the Great Bear to protect his mother, Callisto. 

The name of Arcturus, the brightest star in the Herdsman constellation, means the bear's guardian.

And above Arcturus, in the hunting dog constellation, is a globular cluster called M3.

After passing Arcturus in the Herdsman constellation and extending this curve further, you can find a first-magnitude star, Spica, with white color. The constellation this star belongs to is the Virgin constellation.

The meaning of the name Spica, the brightest star in the Virgo constellation, is barley ear, and it is located at the tip of the left hand of the virgin.

According to Egyptian mythology, the woman of the Virgo is Isis, the goddess of agriculture and fertility. Isis is said to have spilled barley ears she was carrying while fleeing to the sky from her monster brother Typhon, and the barley ears became the Milky Way. 

In ancient Egypt, they called the rain around the time of the fall, "Isis's Tears", they held sacrifices on the banks of the Nile, and measured the depth of the water of the river.

And there are numerous galaxies, called the Virgo Galaxy Cluster, in the upper side of the Virgin constellation. In the center of the M87 galaxy located in the Virgo constellation, there is a black hole emitting a huge jet.

Scientists have converted the wave of a black hole into an audible frequency range by mapping Chandra Telescopeâ€™s X-ray photos, Hubble Space Telescope's visible light area photos, Chile Atacama Radio Telescope's data.

It almost sounds like a magnificent piece of symphony. 

Under the Virgo constellation and above the Crow constellation, there is a Sombrero galaxy shaped like a traditional Mexican hat.

The curve that leads from the handle of the Big Dipper to Arcturus, and then to Spica, is called the Great Arc of Spring, serving as a guide to finding the spring constellations.

There is another shape created in spring.

It's a triangle formed by connecting Arcturus in Bootes

and Spica in Virgo

with another bright star in the west. This star represents the tail of Leo and is named Denebola,
 
and this triangle is called the Great Triangle of Spring.

The lion constellation is a lion caught bare-handed by Hercules, the god of strength in the Greek Nemean Valley, in the myth that Zeus lifted to the sky to make a constellation to let known Hercules's bravery. It is one of the oldest constellations among the total 88 constellations. 

The bright star shining on the lion's chest is called Regulus, known as the lion's heart, and the lion's tail is named Denebola.

The stars corresponding to the lion's head form a peculiar shape, resembling a reversed question mark, known in the West as a sickle. Together with the triangular stars belonging to the lion's hip and tail, one can easily imagine the constellation Leo.

The abundant tail hair of Leo was separated as the constellation Coma Berenices around 240 BC.

In the constellation Coma Berenices, there is a galaxy cluster called the Coma Cluster, where numerous galaxies gather.

The constellation Hercules is a constellation shaped like a large letter H, and its protagonist's name is Hercules.

In this constellation, there is the globular cluster M13, also known as the Hercules Cluster, which appears faintly even to the naked eye. It is a very beautiful object of observation where more than 300,000 stars are densely gathered like a ball.

The constellations representing spring include Ursa Major with the Big Dipper, Bootes with Arcturus, Virgo with Spica, and Leo with Regulus.

Among these, the Big Dipper serves as an important group of stars that helps us find direction in the night sky, particularly aiding in locating the North Star which is known as Polaris.

Since the North Star is located behind your head, making it difficult to see, let's momentarily change our perspective from north to south.

An easy way to locate the North Star

is by finding two of the four stars forming the 'cup' of the Big Dipper 

which are Merak and Dubhe. If you extend a line from these two stars

five times the distance between them in the direction of the 'handle' of the cup

you'll find the North Star located at the end of the Little Dipper's tail.

Now that we've found the North Star, let's find direction in the night sky. Dropping straight down from the North Star will give us the north direction, and its opposite will be the south direction. When facing the North Star directly, the right side becomes east, and the left side becomes west.

As countless stars, each telling their own story in the sparkling universe, begin to hide their traces, the curtains of the night's stage fall.
