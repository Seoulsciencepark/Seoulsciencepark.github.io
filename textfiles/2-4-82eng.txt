The trilobite is a representative fossil from the Paleozoic era that first appeared during the Cambrian period, 570 million years ago, and went extinct during the Late Permian period, 240 million years ago. Its body structure is divided into three parts, which is why it is called a trilobite. Horizontally, it consists of a head, body, and tail, while vertically, it has a left lobe, axial lobe, and right lobe. Its exoskeleton is made of a hard material. Its eyes are compound eyes that can see in a 360-degree range. Size-wise, its length ranges from 1 cm to about 30 cm, with the average being around 5 to 7 cm.
