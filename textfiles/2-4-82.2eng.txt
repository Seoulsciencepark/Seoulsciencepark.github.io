Ammonoids: They were a group of marine mollusks that thrived from the Late Devonian period, about 390 million years ago, to the Late Triassic period, about 190 million years ago. Among them, ammonites are the representative fossil of the Mesozoic era. Body structure: They are divided into two chambers, the phragmocone and the living chamber. Phragmocone: It has partitions and chambers. Living chamber: It contains organs and tissues. Belemnites: They have a different external appearance from ammonoids but have a similar internal structure. They evolved into creatures such as squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses.
