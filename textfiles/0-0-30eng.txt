New Celestial Chart: A constellation chart created based on physiognomy in the Joseon Dynasty (around 1743). The first panel of this chart, which is an eight-panel folding screen, depicts the method of reading the chart, as well as the sun, moon, and five planets, each drawn with different colors, as the title represents the theory of the New Celestial Chart. The second, third, and fourth panels depict constellations centered around the North Pole, while the fifth, sixth, and seventh panels depict constellations centered around the South Pole. The eighth panel contains the titles and names of the individuals involved in creating this New Celestial Chart. The large circle with bold dots represents the celestial equator, and the smaller semicircle with small dots represents the equator. The original of this chart is exhibited at Beopjusa Temple on Songnisan Mountain.
