Tissue culture: Tissue culture is a field of genetic engineering that involves isolating plant organs or tissue cells from a plant, culturing them in a suitable environment, and producing fully functional plants. When a portion of a plant organ is excised and cultured with added nutrients, undifferentiated tissue called callus is formed. Treating this with appropriate plant hormones causes the differentiation of organs such as leaves, roots, and stems, leading to the growth of a complete organism. Although it started at a rudimentary level in the early 1950s, tissue culture has now become universal, allowing the regeneration of any tissue from almost all plant species. It has also become common to manipulate cells or genes for the improvement of varieties or for scientific research purposes, followed by tissue culture. A notable example is the mass production and distribution of plants with low germination rates, such as the eggplant, which used to be expensive until a few years ago but can now be commonly found in households through tissue culture.
