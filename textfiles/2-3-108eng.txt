From DNA to Protein: DNA exists very stably inside the nucleus. However, when a certain gene is needed, it cannot directly do anything, so it first copies its content into a substance called RNA. This process is called 'transcription'. The RNA then goes out of the nucleus and is handed over to a part of the cell called the ribosome, which acts as a ribosome factory. The ribosome assembles amino acids together according to the design provided by the RNA. This process is called 'translation', and as a result, a specific protein is synthesized. Therefore, the genetic information that DNA carries refers to the types and sequence of amino acids that make up the protein. However, not all DNA in a cell is responsible for encrypting proteins. In other words, there are many regions that are not transcribed. These regions also play a role in controlling when and how much a gene will be expressed as protein, as well as contributing to the structure of chromosomes and containing many parts whose functions are still unknown.
