Our body has sensory organs that receive stimuli, a brain that commands appropriate responses to stimuli, and motor organs that produce responses. There are connective pathways called nerves between these components. Nerves are made up of multiple nerve cells called neurons. Types and roles of neurons: Sensory neurons transmit stimuli from sensory organs to the brain and spinal cord. Association neurons connect sensory neurons and motor neurons, allowing for judgment and commands. Motor neurons transmit commands from the brain and spinal cord to motor organs. The nervous system consists of 9 to 15 billion neurons distributed throughout our body and when stimulated, these neurons work closely together to produce unified responses.
