Electrolysis of Water: When a small amount of sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid, which are electrolytes, is added to water and an electric current is passed through, the water decomposes and hydrogen gas is produced at the negative electrode, while oxygen gas is produced at the positive electrode. The amount of gas generated is directly proportional to the intensity of the current, and the volume ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 2:1.

Principle of Hydrogen Rocket Launch: When a spark is applied to the accumulated hydrogen and oxygen inside the reaction chamber, an explosion occurs. The explosion results from a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, releasing water vapor, or steam, and heat energy. The emitted heat energy rapidly increases the pressure inside the reaction chamber, propelling the rocket.

Law of Conservation of Energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it merely changes form. Regardless of the conversion of energy forms, the total energy remains constant. Before the launch of the hydrogen rocket, there was a series of energy conversions, and the energy used to launch the rocket was not newly created, but rather the electrical energy used to electrolyze water.
