Flat sundial: A type of sundial that was created during the Joseon Dynasty, the structure of this sundial is similar to that of the armillary sphere, but it has been flattened and placed on a plane. The flat sundial of the Joseon Dynasty was made by grinding stones, and it was designed to allow the visual representation of time through the shadow cast on the central dial. The time indication is limited to the daylight hours, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and it allows the reading of time in 5-minute increments by dividing each hour into 12 parts. This flat sundial is currently preserved in the Seoul National University Museum.
