Dragon's Rise Phenomenon: When a fast updraft occurs, surrounding air rushes in to fill the void. The path of the air is distorted by the rotation of the Earth, creating a whirlwind. When this whirlwind passes over the water surface, small water droplets are drawn upwards, causing the upper part to become thicker and form a funnel shape. This phenomenon, which occurs in nature, is called the Dragon's Rise Phenomenon.
