Solar power generation refers to the technology of directly converting solar energy into electrical energy using solar cells. When there is no sunlight due to nighttime or clouds, solar cells do not generate electricity, and the generated current varies depending on the intensity of sunlight. Therefore, a solar power generation system consists of small solar panels connected in series or parallel to larger solar panels for supplying the necessary electricity, as well as power storage batteries, power regulators, and DC/AC converters. Solar power generation is used in solar-powered cars, solar streetlights, traffic signals, and other applications.
