The history of rockets can be traced back to the 13th and 14th centuries, where in China or Korea, coins, incendiary devices, and fire arrows were used as propellants for shooting rockets. Towards the end of the 18th century, Congreve of England created solid-propellant rockets that were used in the Indian Wars. Similarly, in 1919, Goddard of the United States launched liquid-propellant rockets into the upper atmosphere, which closely resembled modern rockets. The true modern rocket is the V2, developed by Germany during World War II.
