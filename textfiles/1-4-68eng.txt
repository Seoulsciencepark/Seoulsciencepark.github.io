All molecules are tiny magnets. When they are well aligned in one direction, they become strong magnets, but if they are vaguely aligned, they become weak magnets. If the molecular magnets have different directions, they do not exhibit magnetism.
Objects exhibiting magnet properties: 1. Ferromagnetic materials: substances such as iron, nickel, cobalt, etc., which easily align their molecular magnets in the same direction and become magnets when placed in a magnetic field. 2. Paramagnetic materials: substances such as aluminum, chromium, platinum, oxygen, etc., which do not align their molecular magnets well and do not stick to magnets even when placed in a magnetic field. 3. Diamagnetic materials: substances such as gold, silver, copper, organic matter, etc., which produce a very weak magnetism in the opposite direction to that of ferromagnetic materials when placed in a magnetic field.
