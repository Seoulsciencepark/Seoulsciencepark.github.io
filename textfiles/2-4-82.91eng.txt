Fossilized Dinosaur Footprints of Jeori, Natural Monument No. 373. The dinosaur footprints in Jeori, Geumseong-myeon, were discovered in 1987 while excavating the soil in Saneori during road expansion works in the area of Uiseong County. Jeori's dinosaur footprints are estimated to be from the Cretaceous period, about 150 million years ago, and they were designated as the first natural monument among dinosaur footprint fossils in the country. The large area, approximately 1,656 square meters (about 500 pyeong), contains 316 footprints of both herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, suggesting that this place was a habitat for a large-scale dinosaur population. The well-preserved condition of the footprints allows researchers to study the appearance, size, width, and direction of movement of the dinosaurs, providing valuable information about their appearance and lifestyle back then.
