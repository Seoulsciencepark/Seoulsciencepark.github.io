Parallel Mirror: When two mirrors are installed flat and an object is placed between them, the reflection created on one mirror is reflected again on the other mirror, resulting in the same reflection. In this process, the mirrors engage in infinite reflection, creating an infinite number of reflections. In an exhibit, an infinite number of lamps may appear, but in reality, it is just one lamp reflecting multiple times and appearing as many.
