Whirlpool of water. Experiment: Let's observe the movement of water that occurs inside a water bottle after pressing a switch. Why does a funnel-shaped column form? What substance is inside the column? Why does water rotate? Principle: When a large hole appears at the bottom of stationary water, the water flows out through the hole and rotates due to the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation. The funnel-shaped column is an air column, and the upper part is thicker and the lower part becomes thinner due to hydraulic pressure.
