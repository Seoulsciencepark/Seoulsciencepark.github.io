Principles of the Robot: 1. After pressing the switch, observe the movement of the acrylic plate on the conveyor belt. What is causing the movement of the acrylic plate? 2. Observe the right-hand manipulator. How does it lift the acrylic plate? How does the acrylic plate move to the storage box? 3. Observe the left-hand manipulator. How does it detect the acrylic plate? How does the manipulator move? 4. Where would it be useful to use the robot?

Structure and principles of the robot: When the control unit commands, "Place the objects in the storage room into the designated compartments in the sorting room, one by one," the sensors in the operational unit detect the position, color, thickness, and whether it is metal or not of each acrylic plate, classify them, and then transport them to the specified location. The control unit functions like a human brain, making judgments and giving instructions, while the operational unit plays the role of human eyes, hands, and feet.
