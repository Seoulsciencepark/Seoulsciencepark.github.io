Let's try to catch the objects seen in the three-dimensional image in the empty space. Why can't we catch the objects? If we place two concave mirrors with the same focal length together, the object placed on the bottom concave mirror will be reflected in the direction of the arrow according to the law of reflection, creating a virtual image at the center of the upper concave mirror. This makes the object appear as if it is floating in the air.
