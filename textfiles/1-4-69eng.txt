Why do the magnet rockets and metal rings spring up? There are many coils wound around the launchpad below the ring. When a switch is turned on, a large current flows through the coils, creating a strong magnetic field and inducing a current in the metal ring according to Faraday's law of induction, resulting in a repulsive magnetic field. As a result, the metal ring springs up due to the interaction between the two magnetic fields. The magnet rocket is also made of metal rings and has many coils wound around the bottom of the launchpad, so it springs up using the same principle. The process proceeds as follows: 1. When the switch is closed, current flows. 2. Changes in the current flowing through the coils cause variations in the magnetic field. 3. An induced current is generated in the ring and the magnetic field lines change. 4. The ring springs up due to the repulsive force of the magnetic field.
