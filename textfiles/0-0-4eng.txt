Angbuilgu: A type of sundial created by Jang Yeongsil, Kim Bin, Kim Don, and Lee Chun in the 19th year of King Sejong's reign in Joseon. During the Joseon Dynasty, there were five types of sundials: Angbuilgu, Hyeonjuilgu, Cheonpyeongilgu, Jeongnamilgu, and Gyu Pyo. Among them, Angbuilgu is the most representative. Angbuilgu has an oval-shaped dial that represents 24 seasonal divisions and 13 equinox lines. The equinox lines are divided into 12 equal parts, representing the hours. Animal figures representing the hours are engraved on these lines, and a sundial-shaped symbol with flames is placed diagonally towards the North Pole at the end of the hour lines, where the shadow touches the equinox line, indicating the season. The hour lines represent the time.
