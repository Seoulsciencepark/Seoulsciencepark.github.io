Experiment: Observe the vibration of the liquid inside the tube while varying the frequency. At what Hz does the liquid vibrate? Principle: When the sound emitted from the speaker and the air inside the tube resonate, the amplitude of the air increases, causing the liquid to vibrate as well.

Standing wave of sound: When one end of a string is fixed to a wall and the other end is shaken, continuous waves propagate toward the wall. When the waves reach the wall, they are reflected and bounce back. At this time, the waves heading towards the wall and the waves reflected interfere, forming the shape of the string. By shaking the string with an appropriate frequency, you can obtain a standing wave as shown in the diagram. The vibration of the air column inside the tube is similar. However, since one end of the tube is open, the open end becomes a node, the point of maximum amplitude of the medium's vibration, and the closed end becomes an anti-node, the point where the vibrations cancel each other out.

On the other hand, in an open tube, a standing wave is formed where both ends are nodes. A tube with one node inside is called the fundamental tone (fundamental vibration), and the length of the tube corresponds to half a wavelength of the standing wave. A standing wave with two nodes is called the second harmonic, a standing wave with three nodes is called the third harmonic, and all standing waves that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency can occur.
