A hologram is a three-dimensional representation of a photograph that contains all the information about the surface of an object. Holograms are created by the interference of two laser beams on a photographic film. However, both beams originate from a single laser. One beam reflects off the object and then onto the film, while the other beam, known as the reference beam, reflects off a mirror and onto the film. The interference between the reference beam and the beam reflected from the object creates microscopic patterns on the film. Light reflected from closer parts of the object follows a shorter path to interfere with the reference beam, creating slightly different interference patterns. As a result, a three-dimensional image of the object is recorded. When light shines on a hologram, it diffracts according to the pattern and produces a surface that resembles the original wavefront reflected from the object. Whether viewing a hologram or its reflection, we perceive a realistic three-dimensional image as if looking at the original object through a window or mirror. Holograms can be found in everyday life, such as security patterns or three-dimensional images engraved on credit cards and CDs. Holography is applied in various fields, including industrial materials, security materials, optical products, and counterfeit prevention on banknotes.
