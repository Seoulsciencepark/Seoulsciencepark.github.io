Heavenly Train Field Map: The Heavenly Train Field Map was completed by 12 scholars including Gwon Geun, Yu Bangtaek, Gwon Jung-hwa, and Choi Woo in the 4th year of the reign of King Taejo of Joseon (1395) after several years of research. However, over the years, it has become faded and worn out, so Seokjong re-engraved it in the 13th year of his reign (1687). On the upper part of this astronomical chart, there are short explanations about the 12 divisions and celestial routes, solar and lunar numbers, and the eight directions. Within the three concentric circles at the center, a total of 1,464 stars are marked with dots, and the names of constellations are engraved in their respective positions. Below, the background and progress of this astronomical chart, as well as the official positions, names, and dates of the scholars involved in its production, are recorded.
