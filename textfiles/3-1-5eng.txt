Hydroelectric power generation refers to the method of converting the potential energy of water in high places such as rivers or lakes into kinetic energy and then converting it back into electrical energy. In other words, when water falls, it rotates the turbine attached to the shaft of the hydraulic turbine, generating electricity. The output of the generator is proportional to the product of the head (height at which water falls) and the quantity of water. The quantity of water varies at different locations, but it is proportional to the annual precipitation, and artificial dams are sometimes built or water channels are modified to allow for greater head. 
There are different methods of dam hydroelectric power generation: 
1. Canal-type: Water from a specific point in a river is diverted to create a long canal, and power is generated using the head provided by the slope of the river. 
2. Dam-type: A dam is built on a river, raising the water level upstream and using the head between the upstream and downstream to generate power. 
3. Dam-canal type: This method combines the dam and canal types, creating head to generate power. Generally, if a larger head is desired, water is diverted to create a canal similar to the canal type. 
4. Pumped storage: This method involves creating an artificial reservoir higher than the power plant site or utilizing a natural lake. During off-peak hours, excess electricity is used to pump water to the upper reservoir, and during hours of high electricity demand, water is released to generate power.
