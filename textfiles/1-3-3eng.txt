When the rotation speed of the strobe and the rotation speed of the observation plate are exactly matched, the image is the clearest. Instructions: 1. Press the start switch. 2. Rotate the observation plate using the low-speed or high-speed switch. 3. Rotate the strobe speed adjustment switch and observe when the image on the observation plate stops. 4. Consult the rotations per minute (RPM) of the strobe to determine the rotation speed of the observation plate.
