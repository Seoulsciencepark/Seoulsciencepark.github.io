Fossilized Wood: Fossilized wood is when the chemical components of a plant are replaced by silicon dioxide without changes to the original structure and tissue of the plant. By observing the cross-section of fossilized wood under a magnifying glass, one can observe the growth rings and cells of the wood. Therefore, it is possible to determine the type of plant before it fossilized and even estimate the geological age when the layer was formed. When the components of the plant are replaced by silicon dioxide, small amounts of metallic substances may also precipitate, resulting in various colors. Red color indicates the presence of iron oxide, yellow color indicates the presence of iron sulfide, black color indicates the presence of manganese, and green color indicates the presence of copper and nickel components.
