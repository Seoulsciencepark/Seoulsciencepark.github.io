What is a fossil? Fossils are essential for determining the temporal sequence of sedimentary layers in ancient geological periods and for reconstructing the depositional environment. They are also crucial clues for exploring resources such as petroleum. Types of fossils include:

1. Index Fossils: Fossils that serve as the criteria for determining the geological period in which the stratum was formed.
2. Paleoenvironmental Fossils: Fossils that provide information about the climate, topography, and sea depths at the time of deposition.
