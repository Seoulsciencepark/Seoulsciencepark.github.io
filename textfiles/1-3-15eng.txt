Let's observe the time it takes for two objects to fall to the ground in a vacuum tube and in an air tube. 1. Is the time it takes for the two objects to fall the same in a vacuum tube? 2. Is the time it takes for the two objects to fall the same in an air tube? Explanation: Freefall Motion: Falling objects undergo uniform acceleration due to gravity regardless of their mass. Therefore, in a vacuum, they fall in the same time. However, in an air tube, the time it takes to fall is different due to air resistance.
