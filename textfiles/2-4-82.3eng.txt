Evolution of Ammonoids: The area where the suture line, where the septa and shell meet, is referred to as the suture line. The earlier discovered species tend to have a suture line that is closer to being straight, while the shape of the suture line becomes increasingly complex in later species. Goniatites survived from the Late Devonian to the end of the Permian period, Ceratites survived from the Late Carboniferous to the Triassic period, and the standard fossil of the Mesozoic, Ammonite, thrived until the end of the Cretaceous period. Nautiloids are the Ammonoid species that continue to survive to this day.
