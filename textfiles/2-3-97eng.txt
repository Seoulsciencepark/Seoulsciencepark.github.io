When an ovulated egg from the ovary meets with a sperm, it is conceived and becomes a fetus in the mother's uterine wall. The fetus grows by receiving nutrients and oxygen from the mother through the umbilical cord. After about 3 weeks of conception, the heart starts beating, and at about 8 weeks, fingers and toes begin to form, resembling a human. At around 4 months, various organs take shape and develop, and at 5 months, the fetus begins to move. After 266 days since the meeting of the egg and sperm, the baby is ready to see the world, with a length of about 50 cm and a weight of about 3.5 kg.
