The chromosome is a thin thread-like structure, with a diameter of only 1/50,000 mm. It is made up of a tangled network of thread-like fibers called chromatin. When examined more closely, these threads are composed of a double helix structure called DNA. Genes are located within the nucleus of cells, and their bodies are made up of DNA, which is a type of nucleic acid. DNA consists of many nucleotides bonded together, and a nucleotide is composed of a 5-carbon sugar called deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and one of four different bases. The four types of bases are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). The genetic information is determined by the type and order of these bases.
