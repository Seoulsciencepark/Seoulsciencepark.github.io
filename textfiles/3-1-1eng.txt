What is solar power generation? The sun emits enormous energy through nuclear fusion reactions. The amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth every second is about 2,000 times the amount of energy used by the entire world in a year. An example of directly utilizing this solar energy is a residential hot water device. By scaling this up, it is possible to generate electricity by creating steam from water. There are two major methods for large-scale solar power generation: tower focusing and parabolic trough technology. In tower focusing, a water tank is placed at the top of a high tower, and numerous reflectors are installed around the tower to reflect sunlight onto the tank. This heats the water inside the tank, and the resulting steam is used to generate electricity by turning a turbine. Parabolic trough technology involves installing pipes that carry water at the focal point of a parabolic mirror, allowing steam to be generated.
