Polarization: In general, ordinary light forms an electric field in all directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In contrast, light that forms an electric field only in one direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation is called polarized light. The phenomenon of polarization serves as evidence for the wave nature of light. Polarizing films are used in various applications such as special effect filters for computer monitors or cameras, and 3D movie glasses.
