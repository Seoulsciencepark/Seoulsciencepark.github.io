Banthucochong: A type of brachiopod that thrived during the Upper Carboniferous period, approximately 350 to 280 million years ago. It is considered a key fossil of the late Carboniferous period. Brachiopod fossils provide valuable information about the conditions of the ancient seas, including water temperature, salinity, depth, and the geological state of the seabed at the time of their formation. They also serve as crucial indicators during petroleum exploration. Different species of brachiopods have been discovered from the Carboniferous to the present, with each geological period showcasing unique characteristics, making them excellent standard fossils for estimating the age of rock layers.
