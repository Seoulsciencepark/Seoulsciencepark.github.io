Philsok: A primitive animal that thrived during the Ordovician period, from 500 million years ago to 430 million years ago. It is a standard fossil of the Ordovician period. The soft-bodied structure is rarely found, and only the hard-bodied forams, mistaken as plant fossils, are discovered as gnathostome fossils. It is speculated that Philsok lived by floating in water, with air filled in its hemisphere-shaped structure.
