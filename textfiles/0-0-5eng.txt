Satellite Map: This picture is taken by the artificial satellite (Landsat-7) orbiting around the Earth at a speed of 26,000 km/h in the upper atmosphere at an altitude of approximately 700 km. It is a compilation of images taken between 2001 and 2002, covering an area of 180 square kilometers at a time. The green areas represent densely forested land, while light brown areas indicate areas with fewer trees. The white areas in North Korea depict regions covered by snow, while the white color along the western and southern coastlines represents sediment-rich waters.
