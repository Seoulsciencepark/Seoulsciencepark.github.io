Hwajeon: Hwajeon, or "fire arrows," were arrows with a wad of cotton attached to the front. When shot, the cotton was soaked in oil and ignited, then shot with a bow. Under the direction of Choe Mu-seon during the Goryeo Dynasty, a Bureau of Fire Arrows and Gunpowder Weapons was established, which produced both hwajeon and juhwa (fire pots).
