Fuel cells are high-efficiency, environmentally friendly power generation devices that directly convert the chemical energy of hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. When hydrogen and oxygen are supplied to this power generation device, an electrochemical reaction takes place through the electrolysis of water, generating water and heat while obtaining electrical energy. Fuel cells emit almost no pollutants into the atmosphere, as water is the only by-product. Furthermore, fuel cells have a higher power generation efficiency of 5-20% compared to thermal power generation, and they can be used for power generation even in urban areas due to the absence of noise and vibration. By utilizing waste heat, comprehensive power generation efficiency can be increased up to 80%. Fuel cells have a relatively short construction period for power plants and maintain their efficiency even in small-scale power generation. Consequently, fuel cells and the development of vehicles that use them are gaining momentum.
