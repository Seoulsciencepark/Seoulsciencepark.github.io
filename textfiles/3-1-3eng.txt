Wind power generation is a method in which wind turbines are turned by the natural wind, and the connected generator produces electricity. Wind turbines are classified into horizontal-axis and vertical-axis types depending on the direction of the rotational axis. In order to obtain a constant amount of electricity, it is necessary to rotate the wind turbine at a constant speed regardless of the wind speed, so adjustments such as changing the angle of the turbine blades according to the wind speed are needed. Additionally, to prepare for times when there is no wind, batteries or diesel generators are sometimes installed together. Horizontal-axis generators are easy to install due to their simple structure, but they are greatly affected by the direction of the wind. Vertical-axis generators are more expensive and less efficient, but they are not affected by the direction of the wind, making them suitable for installation in deserts or plains.
