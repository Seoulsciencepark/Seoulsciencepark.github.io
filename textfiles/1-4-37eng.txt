Principle of TV video transmission: When video is taken with a TV camera, it is created as an image using three colors of red, green, and blue pixels. Therefore, the image information is converted into electrical signals representing the intensity of these three colors. TV video transmission refers to the process of sending these electrical signals. The method used in this process is called "scanning," which involves sequentially sending the pixels. Scanning refers to the process of arranging the screen line by line in a sequential manner. In other words, when sending an image, it is sent line by line, and when receiving signals on a TV, they are also received line by line to reproduce the image.
