Topri Formation: This formation is a sedimentary layer that was moved from the base of Mt. Geumseong in Topri, Geumseong-myeon, Uiseong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do. Approximately 100 million years ago, during the Mesozoic era, sedimentary materials were deposited by a prehistoric river, forming part of the Gyeongsang Formation's Songnai-dong layer, which belongs to the Gyeongsang Thrust System. Due to volcanic activity in Mt. Geumseong, this formation has undergone folding and faulting. It is said to take an average of about 50 years for a 1 cm thick layer to be formed in this formation. So, how many years have passed for this formation, which is about 5 meters thick, to accumulate?
