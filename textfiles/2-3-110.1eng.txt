Watson and Crick: Wilkins and Franklin discovered through X-ray investigation of DNA that its structure is helical with a consistent spacing. Subsequently, Watson and Crick elucidated the double helix structure of DNA, achieving a breakthrough in the study of the fundamental genetic material underlying life processes and opening the door to the era of genetic engineering. In recognition of their contributions in unraveling the secrets of life, Watson and Crick, together with Wilkins, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962.
