Acceleration: 1. Let's make the ball roll with the switch. 2. Let's compare the time it takes to pass through each section. (The distance of each section is constant)

Investigation: The law of acceleration in motion, known as the second law of motion, states that when a force is applied to an object, an acceleration is produced that is directly proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
