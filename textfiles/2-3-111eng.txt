What is genetic engineering? It can be defined as the process of appropriately manipulating DNA in order to modify genetic material. In other words, it is a field of biotechnology that uses living organisms to produce substances. In the future, genetic engineering will become the most important academic discipline that determines the future of humanity. What will the future of genetic engineering be like?

The future of genetic engineering: Genetic engineering has already produced super seeds that yield a high harvest, which has changed our dietary habits so far. Genetic engineering can create unfamiliar flowers with new colors and plants that can produce fuel for automobiles. Gene therapy is already providing great hope for people suffering from diseases, and scientists continue to research ways to transplant organs from animals to humans. It remains to be seen if it will be possible to resurrect animals from the prehistoric era, such as the mammoth. Researchers are searching for frozen mammoths in the frigid Siberian region. They will extract the DNA from the mammoth's sperm cell and modify it with the egg of the closest relative, which is likely an elephant. If they spend several generations carefully manipulating genes, they may obtain a nearly purebred mammoth. The future zoo may be populated by fascinating and new animals.

Human cloning: Cloning is not that uncommon. Gardeners have been cloning plants for a long time without knowledge of cloning science. Genetic engineers were also similar, as most of their cloning experiments involved simple organisms like bacteria. However, the situation completely changed when they succeeded in cloning more complex organisms like sheep. If there is a sheep with the finest wool, it is possible to clone identical sheep and create a herd with high-quality wool. However, if such experiments were conducted on humans, there could be challenging ethical issues.
