Refraction of light: It is the phenomenon where the direction of light bends at the boundary when it enters a different medium while traveling. Principle of total internal reflection: When the angle of incidence of laser light going from water to air is greater than the critical angle, the light cannot exit the water and is completely reflected back into the water. Transmission of light through optical fibers: When a light signal is sent through a fiber made of glass, it continues to undergo total internal reflection within the fiber, thus preserving the information.
