Supyo is a device that was used to measure the water level of Cheonggyecheon. It was used from the Sejong era along with the Han River water level gauge, which was carved into rocks along the Han River, to measure rainfall scientifically. The initial device consisted of marking measurements on a wooden pillar of about 2.5 meters, and then securing it between stone pillars, but it was later improved during the reign of King Seongjong by carving measurements directly onto stone pillars. Holes were drilled behind the markings for 3 ja, 6 ja , and 9 ja, indicating drought, normal water level, and dangerous water level, respectively. The Supyo, which was located near Sopyo Bridge in Sopyo-dong, Seoul, is currently preserved at the Sejong Memorial Hall. * 1 "ja" is 30.3cm, 1 "chi" is 0.33cm, and 1 "poon" is 0.003cm.
