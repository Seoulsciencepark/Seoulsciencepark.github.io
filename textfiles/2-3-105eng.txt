Cell Fusion: Cell fusion refers to the process of combining two different types of cells into one and creating a new hybrid cell. This technique is used to create new varieties that combine superior traits from two different organisms. Plant Cell Fusion: 1. Removal of the Cell Wall: Cells are surrounded by a cell membrane. However, plant cells are additionally encased in a tough cell wall made of cellulose. To fuse plant cells, the cellulose must be broken down and the cell wall removed. The cells in this state are referred to as protoplasts, and cell fusion can only occur in this protoplast state. 2. Cell Fusion: There are various methods for cell fusion, but the most commonly used one involves treating with polyethylene glycol. Polyethylene glycol increases the fluidity of the cell membrane, making it easier for the membranes of the two protoplasts to mix and allow the two cells to merge into one. Another method is using electrical stimulation. Applying a brief electric shock to the connected protoplasts destabilizes their cell membranes, causing them to mix and naturally merge into one. After cell fusion occurs, in some cells, the cytoplasm fuses along with the nuclei containing genetic information. Once the cells with nuclear fusion are transferred to a culture medium and cultivated, the cell walls, which were previously removed, will regenerate. By nurturing these regenerated fused cells, they grow into complete plants. Animal Cell Fusion: Animal cells are easier to fuse compared to plant cells because they do not have a cell wall. In other words, excluding the step of removing the cell wall, the remaining process is the same as plant cell fusion. One example of animal cell fusion is the production of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma cells. Monoclonal antibodies mass-produced through hybridoma cells can accurately detect specific pathogens, making them useful for medical diagnosis. Additionally, using antibodies that only bind to cancer cells allows for precise identification of the location of the cancer, and by attaching toxic substances or radioactive materials, it is possible to selectively kill cancer cells while minimizing harm to surrounding tissues.
