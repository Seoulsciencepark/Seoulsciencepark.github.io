Experiment 1: Let's compare the spectra of white light and monochromatic light by pressing the switch. Experiment 2: Let's compare the light that has been dispersed and the light that has been collected again by a prism. Principle: We can see that white light, such as sunlight or light from a bulb, is composed of various colors of light. By gathering this light in one place, we can obtain white light. However, monochromatic light, which is composed of only one color of light, remains the same color even after passing through a prism.
