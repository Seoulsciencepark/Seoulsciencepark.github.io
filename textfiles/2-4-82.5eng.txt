Types of fossils: 1. Preservation of soft organic material: when the remains of an organism, such as a mammoth found in the ice of Alaska, are preserved as they were. 2. Preservation of hard parts: when hard parts like the shell of a clam are preserved. 3. Fossilization process: when the chemical composition of an organism, such as petrified wood, is replaced by different mineral substances. 4. Trace fossils: when traces of biological activity, such as dinosaur footprints, are preserved.
